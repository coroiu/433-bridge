# 433-bridge

Firmware for a 433mhz <-> Particle Cloud bridge based on the Particle Photon using OpenSmart RF433 modules.

# Reliability
Has been up and running for at least half a year without any issues.

# Project status
Currently only supports Jula Anslut 433mhz protocol, which is supposed to be shared by a few other brands. Not tested though.
The code was thrown together over a few weekends as something for me to use personally. Don't expect too much.
